# simple_admin_gui
Currently working on Java GUI with Adminlogin - easy to use with my "minecraft_roleplay_plugin"

+ this Project is not released!

TODO in Login:
 + Anti SQL Injection
 + Encrypt passwords

What your Database needs:
 + table "admins"
 + column "id" in "admins"
 + column "admingroup" in "admins"
 
 You can change it if you compile the src-code by yourself.
 
 STAY TUNED!
